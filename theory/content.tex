\section{Intro}

I need to prove that haskell types and terms that I expose wouldn't break the system.  It means two things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Terms have the same interface: any combination of \texttt{APPLY} that can be used to original(ignoring types)
      term must be usable with generated; and primitives(numbers, strings, ... and their ops) are the same.
\item Types preserve the same set of invariants
\end{enumerate}

\section{Preserving term interface}

This is dealing purely with MAlonzo. I need to show that I pass(and skip) the right arguments when writing wrappers.
As for primitives - they are already the same.

\section{Preserving type invariants}

For example: head on empty vector. From terms perspective it's legal, from types - it's illegal.

This is dealing with logic behind Haskell type system and Agda type system.
For every exported Agda thingy I need to construct a logical statement from
Agda perspective and from Haskell perspective and prove their equivalence.
